## Product order cannot be placed successfully

### Description
While trying to do an order placement, the process fails with an error. Please check the reproducible steps and the image attachment below for more details.

### Repro Steps
1. Login as a customer/user with valid credentials
2. Select/search a product and proceed to the shopping cart with it
3. Add shipping address, billing address and other required information
4. After confirming all the required information are inserted, click on the "PLACE ORDER" button

### Observation
1. Upon clicking on the "PLACE ORDER" button, a error is shown under the button, saying "Failed to create new order". 
2. The network response for this action is 422(unprocessable entity).
3. With Swagger, if this action is attempted with API(via Postman), the request body is "x-www-form-urlencoded", where this action works. However, with the UI, if the order is attempted to be placed, the request body sends the payload in "raw JSON" mode.
